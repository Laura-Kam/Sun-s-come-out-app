# Bugs

- Date function through the API not displaying correctly, due to 5 day weather being displayed 4x a day, instead of once daily. Corrected.
- UV index only able to be retrieved through using latitude and longtitude instead of 'city' search. Corrected through alternative API route.
- Search results have not yet been able to be saved in the div with buttons. Resolved.
